IF YOU GET CONFUSED AT ANY POINT PLEASE REFER TO THE CONFIGEXAMPLE.json file included in the Github repository to clarify where the code snippets go.

Save your file, restart your server and you'll have a custom mission scenario to play with your friends.

After completing a mission you may have to restart your server for the mission to reset.

Thanks, Rob.
